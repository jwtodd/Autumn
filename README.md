## Project

This project is a collection of common/popular libraries brought together via low cohesion means allowing for
rapid creation of modern Java applications brought about by judiciously adhering to near-zero component cohesion.
As such, expected commodity elements are readily available via any number of configurations yet while at the same
time entirely new subsystems can and will be added over time with little overall disruption. Further, every element
can and should be considered as an operational peer to any other element, realizing the principle of
[Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns).

## Getting involved

* Source: [https://github.com/intuit/autumn](https://github.com/intuit/autumn)

The principles of Autumn can be summarized as both a strong leverage of
[dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and consistently specified component
lifecycle management, collectively allowing for significant higher-order application leverage while at the same
time allowing for rapid incorporate of new internal service implementations.

Documentation improvements are always welcome, so please send patches our way.

## Contributing

The `master` branch of this repository contains the latest stable release of Autumn, and snapshots are published to
